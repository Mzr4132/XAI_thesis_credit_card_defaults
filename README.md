# thesis
Hello! 

In this repository a machine learning model can be found that was used for my Bsc thesis. In it the output is saved from the model itself. 
It contains an exploratory analysis of our variables, feature selection, training and testing of the model, evaluation of explainability with SHAP.
The exploratory analysis was taken from Natalino's model which can be found here: https://github.com/natbusa/deepcredit
